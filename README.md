Raspberry Pi powered photo viewer

Java spring boot back end that reads a list of photos from a folder and provides a REST api

Python front end that request a photo. Supports buttons wired to GPIO pins to move / delete / like / unlike a picture

Angular front end that creates a remote control and sends commands to the frame (not working yet as the Pi doesn't seem to respond to the commands)
